This is a project for the HTML and CSS portion of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements). It is a clone of [this article from The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0). I removed some stuff from then end because I didn't want to waste half of my day copying and pasting paragraphs of text!
